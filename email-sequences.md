## PART 2: PROMOTIONAL SEQUENCE (Mailing List)

---

### Promo Email 1: Announcement (Send December 28)

**Subject:** A different way to start 2026

**Body:**

Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},

I'm running a free online workshop on the 3rd and 4th of January, and I wanted to invite you.

It's called One Word.

Here's the idea: instead of resolutions, you choose a single word to guide the next few months. And instead of just thinking about it, you make something — a small clay dish or token with your word carved into it.

I started making pottery in 2013. I was going through a hard time, and my therapist — an art therapist — handed me a lump of clay during a session. The moment my hands touched it, my brain went quiet. For the first time in months.

That single session changed everything for me. I studied with a sculptor for three years after that. Pottery became my way of finding calm — not through thinking, but through making.

This workshop is my favourite way to start a new year. Two hours, your kitchen table, and a word that means something to you.

**Details:**
- **Saturday, 3rd January** or **Sunday, 4th January**
- **2:00 PM UK**
- **2 hours, online via Google Meet**
- **Free**

No experience needed. I'll guide you through everything.

### Promo Email 2: Reminder (Send December 30)

**Subject:** One word (not a whole year)

**Body:**

Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},

Quick follow-up about the workshop I mentioned.

I know January can feel like pressure — all those resolutions, all those plans for the year ahead.

This isn't that.

One Word is about finding a single word to guide the next few months. Not the whole year. Just a direction.

And you don't arrive with your word already chosen. The clay has a way of drawing it out as you work.

By the end, you'll have a small piece with your word carved in — something to put on your desk or windowsill. A quiet reminder.

**Saturday 3rd or Sunday 4th January, 2pm UK. Free.**

### Promo Email 3: Last Chance (Send January 2)

**Subject:** Tomorrow (last chance to join)

**Body:**

Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},

The One Word workshop starts tomorrow.

Two sessions available:
- **Saturday 3rd January, 2pm UK**
- **Sunday 4th January, 2pm UK**

Two hours. Your kitchen table. A piece of clay and a word that matters to you.

If you've been thinking about it, this is the nudge.
